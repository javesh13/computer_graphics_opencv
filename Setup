I am using python as the programming languaege.
Make sure python is added to your command prompt path so that you can execute python from anywhere in your filesystem.

Download python 3.* from python official website and install it and dont forget to check the add to system path checkbox
during installation.
install pip with the help of get-pip.py script

first move to the location of get-pip.py then
execute 
        python get-pip.py
pip will be installed

then install the following packages.
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib 


setup is completed.
